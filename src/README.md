\# Behind the Curtains – LFI CTF



\## Overview

Behind the Curtains is a Docker-based Capture The Flag (CTF) challenge focused on

Local File Inclusion (LFI). The challenge presents a realistic corporate-style

website where one page contains a subtle vulnerability that allows attackers

to read sensitive files from the server.



The goal is to identify and exploit the LFI vulnerability to retrieve the flag.



---



\## Challenge Type

\- Web Exploitation

\- Local File Inclusion (LFI)

\- PHP Stream Wrappers



---



\## Requirements

\- Docker

\- Docker Compose



No PHP, Apache, or additional dependencies are required on the host system.



---



\## How to Run the Challenge



Clone the repository and start the container:



```bash

docker-compose up --build




The web application will be available at:http://localhost:8080



Objective



Explore the website, identify the vulnerable endpoint, and exploit the Local

File Inclusion vulnerability to read the flag stored outside the web root.



Intended Solve Path



Browse the website and inspect how pages are loaded.



Identify a parameter that influences server-side file handling.



Leverage PHP stream wrappers to read arbitrary files.



Use the php://filter wrapper to base64-encode file contents.



Decode the returned base64 output to obtain the flag.



Key Payload

php://filter/convert.base64-encode/resource=/flag/flag.txt





The payload must be base64-encoded before being sent to the vulnerable parameter.



Flag



The flag is stored outside the web root and is generated at container build time.



Flag format:



lnmhacks{cipher476169}



Notes for Organizers



The flag is not present in the repository.



The flag is created dynamically during Docker image build.



Rebuilding the container regenerates the flag environment.



The challenge is fully portable and works across different operating systems.
